## Getting Started

This project uses Reactjs for the frontend, Nodejs 16 for the backend and it's hosted with AWS Amplify. 

To start first fork/clone the repo and run `yarn install` to get all the required packages.

Once installed you can start developing and you can see the changes by running:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## AWS Amplify

This repository is hosted in AWS Amplify that allows it to easily integrate Figma components into reactjs and to be able to deploy automatically for every commit into the main branch. 

For more information regarding Amplify I'll recommend to go to the official documentation: [https://docs.amplify.aws/console/](https://docs.amplify.aws/console/) 

And to get the feeling of what is possible to build with Amplify I'll recommend to check this blogpost [https://dev.to/aspittel/build-a-social-media-timeline-with-amplify-studio-2lof](https://dev.to/aspittel/build-a-social-media-timeline-with-amplify-studio-2lof)
